# This is a list of indices inside the cluster
#
### BY DEFAULT, ALL INDICES have a 365 day  retention period if you add them to the list via name:
#
# - name: index_name
#
# without a key:value pair of days: ###  the indices will default to this 365 data retention period.
# if the indices has a different data retention period then add the days: key and fill in the value, such as:
#
# days: 90
#
#
# INDICES WITH INTEGERS AS NAMES! You must wrap them with quotes. IE:  - name: "1234"
# if you fail to wrap integers with quotes, the script breaks and fails.
